This post is based on Rachael Dempsey's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachaeldempsey_6-steps-to-successfully-bring-open-source-activity-6818633876114546689-_M9l) post on bringing open source tools to your organization.

0. Talk to IT.

IT is concerned about the security of the comapny. The team wants to understand potential security concerns, precedence, why open source is an enterprise asset. It is helpful to write up a document making the case for R to your IT dept. Be persistent but understanding. Want to learn more? Read our blog post on [How Data Scientists and Security Teams Can Effectively Work Together](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/how-data-scientists-and-security-teams-can-work-together/).

1. Produce something.

Just get started. Take whatever data you have available and use that to answer a question for the business. It’s really about those small wins - do a deep dive into the data, learn all you can, and produce even a small insight - something that will wow the team and leads them to ask more questions.

2. Find curious counterparts on the business side.

Communicate and work with people from the business side of the organization to help answer the questions they have. Once you find those answers, they will want to share them. You can get started with open-source tools and then once they find value in this and want to share it more broadly with authentication, you can make the push for other tools.

3. Show the amount of time you saved and put that into `$$`.

This time saved is ultimately saving the company money as well. Calculate that. For example, if a particular Excel process takes you 45-40 minutes a day, what can you save by trimming this down to 4 minutes with R? How does reproducibility save the company money? Think about communicating this as a return on investment.

4. Put your advertising hat on.

How can you market yourself and the work that you’ve done? Place a huge emphasis on being able to explain your work and demonstrate that you understand how people need to consume it, even if this means leaving out a bunch of technical details. If you spend 3x as much time communicating what you’ve done as you did doing the work, it will be worth it.

5. Try to use existing tools.

While we’d love to not do this, try doing something with the existing tools even if it may be painful. Use that to build your business case and explain why it cannot be done this way. When this comes up in meetings, you can clearly show that you’ve already tried this.

6. Find others on your team.

Find all the analytics people across the company, not just the data scientists, and bring people together. People may be scattered across different teams - for example, supply chain, human resources, finance, or sales. They may be R/Python users already or using Excel and BI tools. An internal Slack channel or monthly meetup can help build a community within the organization.
